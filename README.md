This is the functional test suite for the website.
> Formatting and organisation:
1. Organisation of stepdefs will be strictly to the functionality performed and described within the step def. 
- Generic stepdefs will soon get a file for such things as just navigating to the site.
- More libraries shall be added to store Java or Selenium functions such as setting up drivers or generic utilities.
